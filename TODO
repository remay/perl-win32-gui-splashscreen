TODO:
 - documentation
 - Would be good to get paint events from the bitmap label and re-paint the text
 - make the "default" splashscreen nicer
 - add version to non standard splash?
 - make the internally generated splash screen prettier
 - make the functions for internally generated splash autoload, so as not to bloat
   memory usage when there is a user supplied splash screen
 - export ShowSplash (or some such function)?
 - allow registration of a window that must be visible before the splash is taken down

 - get makefile to update version in the readme
