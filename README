Win32-GUI-SplashScreen
----------------------

VERSION

This is Win32::GUI::SplashScreen v0.02

INTRODUCTION

Win32::GUI::SplashScreen is a module that works with Win32::GUI
to implement a Windows application splash screen.

It can generate a simple splash screen from basic text information,
or use a supplied image.  The splash screen can be configured to
have a minimum display time (so that users always have time
to read any information), and can be taken down automatically
once your program reaches the dialog phase.

REQUIRES

Win32::GUI v.02 or higher

DOCUMENTATION

There is full POD documentation inside the SplashScreen.pm file.
There are demonstration scripts provided, showing most of the
features.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Alternatively, as a manual installation, extract the SplashScreen.pm file
from the dirtribution, and put it at C:\Perl\site\lib\Win32\GUI
(adjust as necessary for your Perl installation directory)

A PPM distribution is available at http://www.robmay.me.uk/win32gui/
